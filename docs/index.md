## GameHook Documentation

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. *How do I check for application updates?* \
   GameHook will automatically check for application updates on startup.

2. *How do I check for mapper updates?* \
   GameHook will automatically check for mapper updates on startup once a day and download them.
   This can easily be disabled by updating the application settings.

### Application Settings
These [default settings](https://github.com/gamehook-io/gamehook/tree/main/src/GameHook.WebAPI/appsettings.json) can be overwritten by creating a json file called `appsettings.user.json` in the same folder as your GameHook executable.

## GameHook Documentation

#### Frequently Asked Questions

1. *How do I check for mapper updates?* \
   By default, GameHook will automatically check for mapper updates on startup once a day and download them.
   This can easily be disabled by updating the application settings.

## Application Settings
These [default settings](https://github.com/gamehook-io/gamehook/tree/main/src/GameHook.WebAPI/appsettings.json) can be overwritten by creating a json file called `appsettings.user.json` in the same folder as your GameHook executable.
